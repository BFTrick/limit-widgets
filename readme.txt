A plugin for WordPress that limits the number of widgets in a sidebar.



== Description ==

This is a simple WordPress plugin which allows a site adminstrator to limit the number of widgets in a sidebar. You simply go the the settings -> limit widgets page and customize the maximum number of widgets used for each menu.

You can set widgets to have unlimited widgets by leaving the field blank. You can also set the sidebar to have 0 widgets effectively diabling it.

This is the Internet which means that nothing is created from scratch. This plugin is mostly a combination of work from other people which I just packaged into something with a user interface for easy management.
