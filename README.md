Limit Widgets for WordPress
=============

This is a simple WordPress plugin which allows a site adminstrator to limit the number of widgets in a sidebar. You simply go the the settings -> limit widgets page and customize the maximum number of widgets used for each menu.

Because this is a WordPress plugin that I'm hosting on the WordPress SVN plugin repo I have to keep a readme.txt file to populate the pages in the plugin repo. Since I don't want to maintain two readme's and doing so isn't DRY I'm going to push you, the reader, to the readme.txt file.
